  * *Use more iterations.* The number of iterations is a parameter of the method `minimizeEnergy` of the classes `MinimizerBarnesHut` and `MinimizerClassic` (called in the `main` method of class `LinLogLayout`). While 100 iterations usually suffice for most graphs up to a few hundred vertices, larger or "difficult" graphs may require more iterations. Increasing the number of iterations is particularly helpful if the energy values printed by LinLogLayout still decrease notable during the last 5 percent of the iterations (e.g., from iteration 95 to iteration 100).
  * *Reduce or eliminate gravitation.* The gravitation factor is a parameter of the constructor of the classes `MinimizerBarnesHut` and `MinimizerClassic` (called in the `main` method of class `LinLogLayout`). Gravitation attracts all vertices to the barycenter of the layout. This prevents vertices from being moved to far from the remaining graph, but also distorts the layout. To reduce this distortion, set the gravitation factor to a very small value like 0.01 or 0.001. To eliminate the distortion, set it to 0.0 - but only if the graph is connected, otherwise the unconnected components will fly away into infinity (which will likely cause the minimizer to halt with error messages like "The node distances in the layout are extremely nonuniform.").
  * *Compute several layouts and choose the best.*
